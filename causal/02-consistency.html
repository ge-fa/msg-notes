<h1>Consistency<a class="headerlink" href="#consistency" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>One necessary property of a group session is that everyone sees the same
transcript - that is, the same set of messages and their relative orders.</p>
<p>Everything we mention here will work under both synchronous and asynchronous
transports. Though the specific values of certain time-based variables and
distributions change depending on this, the strategies that we propose will
adapt to any value, i.e. work regardless of the values.</p>
<div class="section" id="reliability-and-consistency">
<span id="reliability"></span><h2>Reliability and consistency<a class="headerlink" href="#reliability-and-consistency" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Consistency can be viewed as a case of metadata verification. Each message has
an author, a context, and some recipients. We verify the author with message
authentication, verify context with parent hash references and by checking
their transitivity and ordering properties, and now we need a way to verify
the (other) recipients, a.k.a. ensure consistency.</p>
<p>Consistency requires reliability. If some messages aren&#8217;t actually received by
everyone, then of course we can&#8217;t possibly verify that they were. Or from
another angle: if we don&#8217;t provide reliability, then consistency checks will
emit so many false positive warnings due to unreliability, that the former
becomes useless to the user as a security indicator.</p>
<p>Earlier proposals for consistency in group messaging protocols, have typically
involved running a process at the end of a session, to ensure consistency for
the whole session. This process is simple to reason about, but not explicitly
robust against any lack of reliability, and does not provide useful information
during the middle of a session.</p>
<p>We prefer an incremental model of consistency, where we continually verify the
other recipients (i.e. consistency) of messages as we accept them, and also
optionally provide reliability if we need to. Below, we describe our strategy
for achieving this, using the causal order from the previous chapter, that has
low communication overhead comparable to said earlier proposals.</p>
<p>We first observe that a message by itself (including metadata), fundamentally
does not contain any information on whether its claimed recipients <em>actually</em>
received it - since any author may author a valid message and simply not send
them to some of the claimed recipients, perhaps with the co-operation of the
transport. Therefore, verifying these recipients must be done strictly <em>after</em>
we accept the message, i.e. <em>after</em> we verify the author via MAC or signature.</p>
<p>Further, if our transport breaks and we receive no more messages, consistency
must not default to &#8220;OK&#8221;. That is, our mechanism must start at a &#8220;MAYBE-BAD&#8221;
state, then warn the user if it does not turn into an &#8220;OK&#8221; state after some
time. So we need a timer primitive; we cannot <em>only</em> run consistency checks as
part of a packet receive-handler.</p>
<p>Before go further into consistency, let&#8217;s briefly remind ourselves of the core
reliability strategy that TCP uses (of which there are many specialisations):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>each packet has a &#8220;sender-seqnum&#8221; that increments as more packets are sent</li>
<li>each packet also contains an &#8220;acknowledged-seqnum&#8221;, to indicate that the
sender has received, from its peer, all packets with <em>that seqnum and lower</em>.</li>
<li>if a sender doesn&#8217;t receive an ack of a seqnum (or a higher one) after a
while, it will resend that packet (and higher ones) to its peer.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be tempting to &#8220;just use&#8221; this transport-level reliability, but there
are <a class="reference internal" href="#transport-reliability"><span>many reasons</span></a> why we reject this, not only as
insecure but also as inappropriate for a truly end-to-end system. Still, the
general ideas are sound; our strategy draws from this, moves it up a few layers
<em>after</em> cryptographic verification, and extends it to work for groups.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="acks-and-full-ack">
<span id="full-ack"></span><h2>Acks and full-ack<a class="headerlink" href="#acks-and-full-ack" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this section, we talk about our <strong>data structures</strong> and <strong>concepts</strong>. We
interpret parent references as an implicit acknowledgements of the parent, and
explore what this means for reliability and consistency.</p>
<p>When we see a message, we want to be sure that everyone else also saw it.
Rather than trying to enumerate and detect all possible failures, we aim for a
certainly-good state. Conveniently, we already have the mechanics for this in
our causal order, namely the property that every message refers transitively to
all its ancestors, via parent references.</p>
<p>We can be sure that r saw m, if we see a message am by r that refers to m,
perhaps indirectly. We call this an acknowledgement, &#8220;ack&#8221; for short. This can
be <em>any</em> message that refers to m, not necessarily a special ACK message; the
references are what&#8217;s important here. Now, we have two cases to consider:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We sent m:<ul>
<li>We assume that we ourselves sent the message consistently to everyone.</li>
<li>We expect that all the recipients will ack the message, so that we know it
was reliabily sent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Someone else sent m to us (and some others):<ul>
<li>We must ack the message ourselves, so that:<ul>
<li>the author knows it was reliably sent</li>
<li>the other recipients know it was consistently sent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We expect that the other recipients will ack the message, so that
we know it was consistently sent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, once a message is acked by all its recipients, and we (i.e. from
the view of a particular member) see these acks, we are sure that it has been
sent both consistently and reliably. We call this state <em>fully-acked</em>, and
afterwards we no longer need to worry about the message. Note that we don&#8217;t yet
know that others have also reached &#8220;full-ack&#8221;, which is a <a class="reference internal" href="#consistency-vs-consensus"><span>harder problem</span></a>. But this is OK, as argued in more depth later - we
never actually need to know this.</p>
<p>In more precise terms: given a valid transcript T, we define that a message m
is <strong>acked-by</strong> r iff ∃ m&#8217; ∈ by(r): m &lt; m&#8217;, and is <strong>fully-acked</strong>
iff ∀ r ∈ recipients(m): m is acked-by r. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#npvis" id="id1">[1]</a> Note that m
becomes fully-acked at the same position for everyone <a class="footnote-reference" href="#nfack" id="id2">[2]</a>, namely just
after T accepts all of its direct acks <strong>diracks(m)</strong> = { min(by(r) ∩
des(m)) | r ∈ recipients(m) }, des(m) being the descendant messages of m,
and min(∅) = ⊥. Notice the similarity to context(m) - one may
think of these as a &#8220;future&#8221; context(m). If and when full-ack is reached, this
will contain no ⊥ values. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#nimpl" id="id3">[3]</a> To visualise this:</p>
<p class="graphviz">
<img src="../_images/graphviz-3a81d46ab02edb49af38a25ea575c4c1a75d2b3b.png" alt="digraph acks {

<p>Background colours indicate authorship, red borders indicate messages that are
not yet fully-acked. If blue then sends a message referring to r, s, it will
cause p to become fully-acked, and help r, s along on the way towards being so.
This is an incremental consistency; full-acks occur as new messages arrive,
instead of all at once at the end of the session.</p>

<div class="section" id="ack-monitors">
<h3>Ack monitors<a class="headerlink" href="#ack-monitors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned before, we expect all messages to become fully-acked, so we need
an active process outside of the send/recv logic to manage this and warn or try
to recover if it takes too long. We call this an &#8220;ack-monitor&#8221;; we activate a
new one for each message accepted, and de-activate it on full-ack. The basic
behaviour is to warn the user if full-ack is not reached within a grace period
and cancel/reduce this warning if it is reached afterwards, with some nuances
and exceptions that we&#8217;re about to go into. Later on, we&#8217;ll use it to implement
a primitive reliability mechanism as well.</p>
<p>For everyone to reach full-ack, each member must send an ack, for each message
they received and did not send themself. But it is very wasteful for everyone
to send an empty message simply to ack previous messages that have content;
this would multiply the number of packets sent. So instead, we&#8217;ll come up with
a more efficient strategy.</p>
<p>Define an <strong>explicit</strong> ack as a message whose only purpose is to acknowledge
previous messages via its parent references, with no content or other semantics
in the body of the message, and an <strong>implicit</strong> ack as a message with a body,
that incidentally acknowledges previous ones. Explicit acks should not be
displayed as a message in the UI, but it is still kept in the transcript graph,
as a message object that differs from other message objects in its type and the
fact that it has no body.</p>
<p>We observe that, in a typical session, a member will probably send a message
after a certain period <em>anyway</em>, which is an implicit ack of previous messages.
Then, we (as their local process) don&#8217;t need to send an explicit ack on behalf
of them. So, in our system, we may set our full-ack warning timeout roughly to
this expected time-to-reply, and just wait this out. Then, during a lull in the
session when there are no replies after the timeout, or at its end when members
commit to not sending any more messages, we may fall back to sending explicit
acks automatically. This most naturally done within the ack-monitor, since that
runs the timeouts.</p>
<p>Since explicit acks carry no other semantics, we don&#8217;t care if they are not
fully-acked, so we don&#8217;t need to activate a new ack-monitor for it. That is, we
don&#8217;t need to warn the user if it is not fully-acked after a timeout, nor to
send a further automatic explicit ack to ack it. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#nainf" id="id4">[4]</a></p>

<div class="section" id="ack-semantics">
<h3>Ack semantics<a class="headerlink" href="#ack-semantics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A normal message (that was manually sent) indicates &#8220;some&#8221; understanding of the
content of previous messages. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#nread" id="id5">[5]</a> On the other hand, an explict ack that
was sent automatically <em>should not</em> be interpreted to carry the same weight,
since the user has no control over whether they actually read its ancestors or
not. If the application wishes to provide an explicit &#8220;user understood&#8221; ack,
useful for timing-critical situations, they may add:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a manual explicit ack, that must be initiated by the user - like acks in
<a class="reference external" href="https://pond.imperialviolet.org/tech.html">Pond</a>, which are just empty messages.</li>
<li>a pseudo-manual explicit ack, that may be interpreted like a manual explicit
ack. This is triggered automatically, but only when the user is interacting
with the application, or has it focused in the foreground.</li>
</ul>
<p>These would be implemented as a separate message type, distinguishable from and
not replacing our automatic explicit acks from the previous section.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the application may avoid adding any extra features, and just
have the user manually send the string &#8220;ack&#8221; (or equivalent) in a normal
message. Semantically this is an explicit ack, but the application would be
unable to distinguish it from an implicit one.</p>
<p>Other projects&#8217; terminology for these concepts include &#8220;delivery receipt&#8221; for
&#8220;automatic ack&#8221; and &#8220;read receipt&#8221; for &#8220;manual/pseudo-manual ack&#8221;.</p>

<h2>Timing concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#timing-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We generally avoid require consideration of time periods, and prefer to reason
about the relative ordering of events. However, as described previously, some
parts of our design could not be achieved without this, namely grace periods
and warning timeouts. Let&#8217;s attempt to define these more precisely now. There
is a lot of depth here, and we won&#8217;t go all the way down the rabbit hole, but
it is useful to sketch out a semi-formal framework for reasoning about these
concepts, so that we can build an initial concrete software implementation that
can be extended later without re-writing everything.</p>
<p>Here are some concepts that form a foundation for our later ideas:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">BC_LAT</span></code>:</dt>
<dd>Broadcast latency. This is the time taken for one packet to reach all of
its recipients. In a 1-to-1 communication context, this is equivalent to
half of the round trip time (RTT).</dd>
<dt><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">M_INTV</span></code>:</dt>
<dd>Message interval. This is the time in between successive messages sent by
a single member. In a real session, this would probably increase as the
number of members increases.</dd>
<dt><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FA_INTV</span></code>:</dt>
<dd>Full-ack interval. This may be defined as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2</span> <span class="pre">*</span> <span class="pre">BC_LAT</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">M_INTV</span></code>, assuming
that each member, if they don&#8217;t implicitly ack a message, will send an
automatic explicit ack of it after <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">M_INTV</span></code>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The base concepts are random variables, that take different concrete values for
particular instances of a relevant event. For the purposes of our messaging
system, we are interested in picking a cut-off value s (which may depend on the
environment and not necessarily be constant) below which we deem an event to be
&#8220;innocent&#8221;, and above which we&#8217;ll treat as abnormal and maybe serious enough to
emit a user warning, such as &#8220;not fully-acked&#8221; for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FA_INTV</span></code>. When we refer
to an <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ALL_CAPS</span></code> name, it will hopefully be clear from the context whether we
mean a single event, the distribution of events, or the cut-off value.</p>
<p>For each cut-off value s, a basic simple estimate would be to model the
distribution P(t = s), where t is the r.v. on the time it takes for the event
to happen, and pick s to be the 95% percentile value for t.</p>
<p>A more precise treatment would model the joint distribution P(R, T(s)), where R
is a r.v. on whether reality is good (we are not under attack) and T(s) is a
r.v. on whether our test passed (t &lt; s) or failed (t &gt; s), and choose s to
maximise some information retrieval metric (e.g. precision, recall, f1-score)
defined in terms of the distribution. However, we would need lots of data and
complex ML inference techniques to do this properly, so we skip it for now.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resends-and-duplicates">
<h2>Resends and duplicates<a class="headerlink" href="#resends-and-duplicates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this section, we talk about our <strong>algorithms</strong> and <strong>execution strategy</strong>.
We look at a fundamental building block of reliability mechanisms, that is to
actively resend messages, as well as how to react to duplicate messages.</p>
<p>Our basic reliability mechanism is to periodically resend the packet for a
message m, until m is fully-acked. It seems most natural to implement this
behaviour in the ack-monitor for m, since this detects the full-ack condition.</p>
<p>However, explicit acks do not have ack-monitors on them, so we must guarantee
their reliability a different way. We&#8217;ll do this by having each ackmon resend
not only its subject message m, but also chains of explicit acks sent directly
before it, namely { p | p ∈ anc(m) ∧ EA(p) ∧ ∄ q: p &lt; q &lt;
m ∧ ¬ EA(q)} where EA(x) is true if x is an explicit ack.</p>
<p>This still misses out explicit acks that have no implicit acks after them; we
cover this last case indirectly by how we deal with duplicates.</p>
<p>Define a <strong>duplicate</strong> packet as one that verifies-decrypts to a message with
the same metadata (author, parents, recipients) and data as an already accepted
message. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#ndupq" id="id6">[6]</a> Suppose we receive a duplicate packet d from sender s for a
message m. This is because s hasn&#8217;t yet reached full-ack on m:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If we authored m, there is nothing more we can do to help s reach full-ack.</li>
<li>Else, someone else authored m, and we are:<ul>
<li>not meant to ack it (e.g. it&#8217;s an explict ack), so have nothing to do.</li>
<li>meant to ack it, and have set an ackmon on it.<ul>
<li>If we haven&#8217;t yet acked it, the ackmon will ensure that we ack it.</li>
<li>Else, we have acked it with message am, but s has not received this.
Then, they won&#8217;t ack am either. Either am is:<ul>
<li>meant to be acked, and we have set an ackmon on it. Then, it will
detect that s hasn&#8217;t acked am, and resend it automatically. (Or s
already acked am, and d was received due to a transport glitch or an
attempted replay attack. In any case, we take no action here.)</li>
<li>not meant to be acked, so we didn&#8217;t set an ackmon on it. But we have no
other process to resend it, so we should resend it now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The reliability scheme outlined above is quite implicit - we decide when to
resend packets using inference based on unmet expectations, and avoid explicit
&#8220;request resend&#8221; messages. More research is needed to optimise performance; in
practise, we are using an exponential backoff algorithm with base interval
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">BC_LAT</span></code>, but first wait for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FA_INTV</span></code> before starting the iterations, with
an extra throttle to reduce multiple members from resending the same packet
many times in quick succession. This has worked adequately, and our underlying
scheme has a clear logical justification, so we&#8217;ll continue with other topics.</p>

<div class="section" id="single-ciphertext-principle">
<span id="single-ciphertext"></span><h3>Single-ciphertext principle<a class="headerlink" href="#single-ciphertext-principle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To simplify resends, we suggest to follow the &#8220;single-ciphertext principle&#8221; -
each message is communicated as the same ciphertext for everyone, and this
applies even if parts of it are encrypted to only a subset of the recipients.
This makes it easy to detect duplicate resent messages, and also enables each
member to resend messages authored by someone else.</p>
<p>For each message m, all members cache its ciphertext c in case they need to
resend it to others, even if they didn&#8217;t author it themselves. After m is
fully-acked, c need never be resent again. However, implementations may still
wish to store it for a while (at most, until when diracks(m) are themselves all
fully-acked), so that they can recognise c if it is resent by others, and
handle it as according to our de-duplication scheme.</p>
<p>Caching ciphertext should not affect security (e.g. forward secrecy) of the
message, since the threat model already includes an eavesdropper that
permanently stores all ciphertext.</p>
<p>If an entity - e.g. an XMPP server - can observe multiple recipients receiving
the same ciphertext, then this links these recipients. Hiding this metadata is
outside of the scope of this chapter, and adhering to the single-ciphertext
principle makes this leak no worse than existing systems, but newer systems
that try to explicitly provide unlinkability will need to think about this.</p>

<h2>Transcript consistency<a class="headerlink" href="#transcript-consistency" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For any given message, we have a mechanism to reach consistency for it and its
ancestors. To achieve &#8220;transcript consistency&#8221; then, we just need to define
clearly what the &#8220;transcript&#8221; is, then apply this mechanism. This reduces down
to defining what the final messages (i.e. maximum in the causal order) are,
which fully determines the rest of the transcript.</p>
<p>We begin as usual, by taking inspiration from our old friend TCP. We abstract
its concrete mechanism, then translate this to the group messaging context. The
TCP close process is actually two separate processes, that each close one half
of the full-duplex (send, recv) stream pair:</p>

</table>
<p>We&#8217;ll use these concepts as a base from which to explore and develop concrete
proposals for defining the &#8220;end&#8221; of a session. They also form a common ground
to help explain our proposals to others. The first naive idea that arises is to
define the session transcript as the union of the ancestors of everyone&#8217;s FIN
messages. To reach consistency, we wait for all of these to become fully-acked.
However, this only works well if everyone wants to leave the session together.</p>
<p>To define a double-half-close process in a group session requires more precise
treatment of how this interacts with membership changes. Intuitively, when the
receive side closes (i.e. &#8220;everyone has no more to send me&#8221;) is exactly when I
am excluded from the session, but what does the send side correspond to? We&#8217;ll
explore this later in <a class="reference internal" href="05-visibility.html"><em>partial visibility</em></a>; for now we
skip this to propose a single-full-close process as an intermediate feature.</p>
<p>The process is as follows: when we want to part, we send a <em>both-FIN</em> message
zm, that means &#8220;I have no more to send, and I will accept no more from anyone&#8221;.
Then, we wait for explicit acks to it. Once it is fully-acked, we reach
consistency for all of anc(zm), which we&#8217;ll define as the session transcript.
Recipients should ack these quickly e.g. within some small ratio of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">BC_LAT</span></code>,
instead of waiting the usual grace period before sending a normal automatic
explicit ack. On the other hand, since there won&#8217;t be any future chance to
receive the acks, they may use a longer-than-usual &#8220;not-fully-acked&#8221; timeout.</p>
<p>If we receive user messages not in anc(zm), we must ignore them or display/log
them permanently with a warning, because we have no chance to verify their
consistency - and we committed to not accepting them anyway when we sent zm.</p>
<p>If we fail to reach full-ack for zm (i.e. time out waiting for this), then we
still have consistency for all the messages we had previously reached full-ack
for, which hopefully is almost equal to anc(zm). For all other messages, we
should display/log them permanently with a warning.</p>
<p>Even if we reach full-ack for zm, this process does not guarantee that others
know that we have reached this good state. Likewise, TCP has no <em>guaranteed</em>
confirmation that a peer received our ACK to their FIN. We <a class="reference internal" href="#consistency-vs-consensus"><span>don&#8217;t believe</span></a> this to be a security problem, however.</p>
<p>We have not yet suggested what the remaining members should do to continue the
session without us. This will be explored later, together along with the other
issues on membership changes mentioned above.</p>

<span id="transport-reliability"></span><h3>Transport-level reliability<a class="headerlink" href="#transport-level-reliability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Commonly, cryptographic protocols ignore reliability, and assume it will be
covered by a lower layer. The prevalence and relative success of TCP today
probably encourages this. However, this is not always the best thing to do if
one wants true end-to-end security properties, and we reject this for our group
messaging scenario.</p>
<p>Sometimes there is confusion on what &#8220;reliability&#8221; actually means. Let&#8217;s clear
this up now. Reliability is <em>not</em> about preventing drop (or denial of service)
attacks; we assume that an attacker can always just drop everything if they
want to. Protection from the external consequences of a drop attack is outside
of our immediate scope, though we may return to it later. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#ndrop" id="id7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Instead, reliability is about trying to recover from ordinary non-malicious
transport failures. As mentioned earlier, these failures will eventually cause
a failure of consistency checks, so it is &#8220;secure&#8221; to forego reliability in the
sense that a bad condition will never be presented as a good one. But compared
to true positives (i.e. failures due to actual attacks), innocent transport
failures are very common, so not minimising false positives would expose us to
the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy">base rate fallacy</a>. Another way of putting this is that a warning which
95% likely to be a false positive is useless security information, and a very
bad user experience that may incentivise them towards less secure applications.</p>
<p>Reliability is independent from asynchronity. Asynchronity is the ability of a
transport system to deliver a packet to all recipients even if some are not
available (online) when the sender sends it. It is perfectly possible and
desireable to build a communications system to be reliable <em>and</em> asynchronous.
<a class="footnote-reference" href="#nmail" id="id8">[8]</a> In fact, the problems with transport layer reliability that we will
mention, become more apparent and severe in an asynchronous setting; this
reinforces our argument that reliability is best achieved in the messaging
layer, <em>after</em> end-to-end verification.</p>
<p>When talking about security or liveness properties, it is important to specify
the subject and context of these properties. For example, the term &#8220;end-to-end
encryption&#8221; was coined as a response to distinguish it from applications that
make a big deal out that they &#8220;use encryption&#8221;, but this turns out only to be
in the transport layer between devices, and do not provide properties that are
actually relevant to users, i.e. user-to-user confidentiality. Likewise,
transport layer reliability is not directly relevant to messaging users, whom
would rather have user-to-user reliability.</p>
<p>We continue our argument with a recap of internet architecture. The internet
is a global device-to-device communications system (&#8220;transport layer&#8221;) that
enables pairs of devices (each with an IP address) to talk to each other, even
if they are not directly connected via physical links. In this context, the
<em>ends</em> are a pair of devices in this network, and each communication unit (IP
packet) has a <em>from</em> and a <em>to</em> address that identifies these. The middle or
<em>core</em> of the network are devices such as routers and switches, whose purpose
is to forward others&#8217; packets correctly rather than sending their own packets.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the context of user-to-user communications systems (&#8220;application
layer&#8221;), the ends (i.e. user devices) typically do not communicate <em>directly</em>
using the IP protocol. Instead, communication is routed over several non-user
IP devices, such as web, email, or chat servers. This can be viewed as an
application-level virtual <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network">overlay network</a> on top of the internet, whose
middle nodes are end nodes in the context of the internet.</p>
<p>On the internet, the core attempts to provide a service (packet delivery), and
the edges verify and attempt to enforce that this was provided (reliability).
<a class="footnote-reference" href="#ndumb" id="id9">[9]</a> There are many good reasons for this separation of concerns in the
network architecture. These include network resilience against attacks, edge
robustness against different network failure modes, and resource and complexity
constraints of the core to help network scalability. Our insight is that these
reasons also hold in the group messaging context (a user-to-user communications
system), and that user-to-user reliability is best achieved on the edges (ends)
of its overlay network. To expand on some of these:</p>
<p><strong>Failure modes</strong>. With transports that run via a third party, the transport
layer cannot detect certain end-to-end reliability failures, even if these
parties are honest. For example, even if a sender&#8217;s TCP subsystem delivers a
packet reliably to the chat server (&#8220;first hop&#8221; in the application overlay
network), it does not attempt this to the other recipients (the subsequent
hops). The server&#8217;s own TCP subsystem may attempt this, but we (the sender)
have no way to find out whether it succeeds, nor <em>verify</em> this. The recipients
may even be offline, in which case reliable delivery (at least over TCP) is
impossible, even if they were online at the time of the original send.</p>
<p><strong>Resource constraints</strong>. Some servers try to mitigate the above failure modes,
by resending packets to those offline clients when they come back online.
<a class="footnote-reference" href="#nxmpp" id="id10">[10]</a> But in all cases, the scope of this reliability is limited: by time,
by packet-count, or by some other resource. This is an inherent limitation of
public servers: they cannot offer <em>unconditional</em> user-to-user reliability
since this requires unconditional buffering of unacked packets - but that may be
abused by malicious clients resulting in denial of service. Even if they did
provide this, the clients still need a way to <em>verify</em> it. By contrast, user
clients have the incentive to indefinitely buffer their own not-fully-acked
messages, and the ability to verify the success of their delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong>. Reliability that works on a lower layer are not end-to-end
authenticated, and therefore may be forged. For example, in a MUC chat server
scenario that forces TLS, we achieve reliability and authentication in the
transport (the internet), but not on the application layer (between the chat
users) - the server can easily forge ACKs from each member to everyone else. We
only achieve the latter if reliability occurs <em>after</em> end-to-end verification.</p>
<p><strong>Correctness.</strong> ACK failures necessarily can only happen <em>after</em> delivery, but
TCP doesn&#8217;t notify higher layers about these. If the recipient drops their
connection right after you pass your payload to your TCP subsystem, they will
never ack this to you, so in general we won&#8217;t know if the peer received our
packet. TCP assumes that the higher layer will detect it (e.g. when a reply is
missed), or that it&#8217;s not important. However, this assumption is not safe in
general, and for group messaging the higher layer is human users who are
generally unreliable at automatically noticing implicit semantic details. So we
choose to pass these notifications explicitly.</p>
<p>To be clear, we do <em>not</em> suggest that transport reliability schemes should not
be used. Everyone already has TCP for free, and it recovers from very common
transport failures. Rather, we argue that it is vital to have a &#8220;last guard&#8221;
mechanism on the application layer, that provides better guarantees and lower
false positive rates, <em>whether or not</em> we have transport reliability.</p>

<div class="section" id="consistency-vs-consensus">
<span id="id11"></span><h3>Consistency vs consensus<a class="headerlink" href="#consistency-vs-consensus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In our usage, consistency is <em>not</em> consensus. Consensus is about agreeing on a
future value or action, that has not been decided yet; consistency is about
agreeing on past history, that has already happened. So we don&#8217;t need to use
Byzantine fault tolerance techniques (which have probabilistic success), and
can achieve a stronger guarantee with simpler techniques.</p>
<p>With consistency, we only achieve &#8220;first-order&#8221; knowledge - that is, for each
message m, from the view of a member u, u knows (P: everyone has seen m), but u
doesn&#8217;t know if (Q: others know P), nor (R: they know u knows P), etc. For
comparison, consensus requires us to achieve <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)">common knowledge</a> (i.e.
&#8220;infinite-order&#8221; knowledge).</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t foresee any situation where we need those latter properties, and we
believe that their absence is not a security problem. It is the responsibility
of each user to check that all messages they see are fully-acked. For a message
m that we acked with am, even though we don&#8217;t explicitly check if the recipient
actually received am, we know at least that if the transport drops am, they
would not treat m as fully-acked, i.e. a maybe-unsafe situation would not be
presented as safe. Further, the way that we handle resent duplicate packets
gives some extra confidence in this particular scenario - similar to how TCP&#8217;s
TIME_WAIT state handles FIN resent by the peer, when the ACK to it is dropped.</p>
<p>A related concept that <em>does</em> provide a guarantee for explicit acks, is
<a class="reference internal" href="03-freshness.html#heartbeats"><span>heartbeats</span></a>. These can be thought of as automatic explicit
acks that result in an infinite sequence of mutual acks. But their purpose is
to ensure freshness rather than consistency, and their cost may be unsuitable
for some asynchronous protocols. So we omit them here, and talk about them
separately as an optional feature.</p>
