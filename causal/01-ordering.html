<h3>Partial orders<a class="headerlink" href="#partial-orders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A <strong>partial order</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set">wikipedia</a>) is a set of elements
with a binary relation ≤ that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.
For convenience, we also define ≥ (<cite>after</cite>) such that a ≥ b ⇔ b ≤
a, and ⊥ (<cite>independent</cite>) such that a ⊥ b ⇔ (¬ a ≤ b ∧ ¬ a
≥ b). Note that in a partial order, ¬ (a ≤ b) does <em>not</em> imply a ≥ b;
this is true however for <cite>total orders</cite> a.k.a. <cite>linear orders</cite>.</p>
<p>This can be visualised as a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graph</a> (DAG), where nodes
represent the elements, and paths represent the relationships:</p>

<p>In the diagram above, where an edge a ← b means that a ≤ b,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>red nodes (and m <a class="footnote-reference" href="#lang" id="id1">[1]</a>) are <cite>before</cite> m; all others are <cite>not-before</cite> m.</li>
<li>green nodes (and m) are <cite>after</cite> m; all others are <cite>not-after</cite> m.</li>
<li>grey nodes are neither before nor after m, but <cite>causally independent</cite> of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using this, we begin to define our data model and its &#8220;real world&#8221; semantics.
Each node m ∈ G represents a message <a class="footnote-reference" href="#rxtx" id="id2">[2]</a>; a ≤ b (a <cite>before</cite> b) means
&#8220;the author of b knew the contents of a, when they wrote b&#8221;. Transitivity also
implies that they knew all the messages before a as well (i.e. anc(a), see
below), when they wrote b. We&#8217;ll talk about how to <em>enforce</em> these semantics
soon; for now we continue with its <em>structural properties</em>:</p>
<p>To reduce visual clutter later, let&#8217;s further define:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>anc[G](m)</strong> = {a ∈ G | a ≤ m} &#8211; m is a message, G is a graph or subgraph</dt>
<dd>The set of ancestors of m, including m. This is the <cite>possible transitive
causes</cite> of m, like the discrete equivalent of a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone">light cone</a>. Sometimes it&#8217;s
obvious which G we are talking about, in which case we&#8217;ll omit [G] and write
simply anc(m). <a class="footnote-reference" href="#ancg" id="id3">[3]</a></dd>
<dt><strong>max(G)</strong> = {a ∈ G | ∀ v ∈ G: ¬ v &gt; a} &#8211; G is a graph or subgraph</dt>
<dd>The latest messages in G. Note that unlike with total orders, this is not a
single element, but a set of nodes that are all causally independent of each
other, i.e. form an <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antichain">anti-chain</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In our scheme, each message m declares its <cite>immediate predecessors</cite> (<cite>parents</cite>)
P = <strong>pre[G](m)</strong>. This is why we drew &#8220;←&#8221; for ≤ earlier, rather
than &#8220;→&#8221; - the references belong to the later message; one cannot
predict in advance what messages will come after yours. <cite>Predecessors</cite> means
that ∀ p ∈ P: p &lt; m, and <cite>immediate</cite> means that there is nothing
between them, i.e. ∄ q: p &lt; q &lt; m.</p>
<p>The reason we mandate <cite>immediacy</cite> is to eliminate redundant information and
simplify security checks; this will be explained in more detail at the end of
the next section. For now, note that one consequence of <cite>immediacy</cite> is that all
parents form an anti-chain, and that pre(m) ≡ max(anc(m) \ {m}). Over
the whole session, it means that messages (nodes) and their parent references
(edges) form a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_reduction">transitive reduction</a> over the ≤ relationship.</p>

<h3>Causal orders<a class="headerlink" href="#causal-orders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Now we formally introduce agents that can observe and generate events, that we
mentioned informally when discussing the real world semantics of ≤.</p>
<p>In a <strong>causal order</strong>, each event m has exactly one <strong>author(m)</strong> and a set
<strong>readers(m)</strong>, both together called its <strong>members(m)</strong>. We also define:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>by[G](u)</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">The set of all messages authored by u in G. This is totally-ordered on ≤
i.e. every element is either before or after every other, so it can be
represented as a list. This property constrains the number of branches that
may exist in any G, and helps it be &#8220;more linear&#8221;, and we can use this to
prove performance bounds on various operations on G.</p>
<p class="last">Unlike with anc[*](m) and pre[*](m), this is generally not constant even if
G₀ ⊆ G₁, so notation-wise we&#8217;ll omit [G] less often.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>context[G](m)</strong>: members(m) → anc(m) = u ↦ max1(by[G](u) ∩ anc[G](m))</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This is a mapping (a.k.a dictionary, associative array) from each member of m
(call this u), to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>m itself, if u is the author of m; or else</li>
<li>the latest message authored by u, that was seen by the author of m when
they wrote m; or else</li>
<li>⊥ (<cite>null</cite>) if no such message exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Above, max1() gives the (single) maximum element of a totally-ordered set, or
⊥ if it is empty.</p>
<p class="last">As with anc[*](m) and pre[*](m), notation-wise we&#8217;ll often omit [G] for the
same reasons. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#ancg" id="id4">[3]</a></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Context is semantically equivalent to a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock">vector clock</a> - a mapping from each
entity to some representation of the latest event that the clock&#8217;s owner saw
from them. As with vector clocks, this contains redundant information, and may
be locally calculated recursively from pre(m) as follows:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>context(m)[u] =</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>if author(m) = u : m</li>
<li>else: max1({ context(p)[u] | p ∈ pre(m) } \ {⊥})</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>TODO: probably move most of the rest of this section to the appendix, it
doesn&#8217;t add that much insight or new constructive models.</p>
<p>But watch out! A minor &#8220;optimisation&#8221; will make this susceptible to re-ordering
attacks:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>context(m)[u] =</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>if author(m) = u : m</li>
<li>else if (∃ p ∈ pre(m): author(p) = u) : p &#8211; <strong>insecure optimisation</strong></li>
<li>else: max1({ context(p)[u] | p ∈ pre(m) } \ {⊥})</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The attack allows malicious authors to <cite>rewind</cite> the context they are supposed
to declare with each message; vector clocks can also suffer from this if the
implementation makes too many naive assumptions.</p>
<p>The problem stems from trusting pre(m) too much in the latter definition. For
example, C should not be allowed to claim that their last-received-from-A is 9,
if they&#8217;ve already claimed that their last-received-from-B is 12, but in
message 12, B claimed that their last-received-from-A is 10. A more simple
version of this with only 2 members is in the diagram below:</p>

</p>
<p>We must forbid the 1 ← 4 reference. More generally, we want context
to always advance, never rewind. We&#8217;ll call this <em>context consistency</em>, and
formally it means:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">∀ m&#8217;, m ∈ G: m&#8217; &lt; m ⇒ context(m&#8217;) ⊏ context(m) where</div>
<div class="line">c&#8217; ⊏ c (c&#8217; is <cite>strictly-less-advanced</cite> than c) is defined as:</div>
<div class="line">c&#8217; ≠ c ∧ ∀ u: c&#8217;(u) = ⊥ ∨ c&#8217;(u) ≤ c(u)</div>
</div>
<p>A related concept is <cite>parent consistency</cite> - we must never reference parents of
strictly-earlier messages, since it is redundant and we should instead simply
reference the strictly-earlier message itself. Formally:</p>
<p>∀ m&#8217;, m ∈ G: m&#8217; &lt; m ⇒ ∀ p&#8217; ∈ pre(m&#8217;), p ∈
pre(m): ¬ p ≤ p&#8217;</p>
<p>These properties are quite complex. But we don&#8217;t have to check them directly:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: <cite>transitive reduction</cite> entails <cite>parent consistency</cite>. Proof sketch:
if m&#8217; &lt; m then ∃ p ∈ pre(m): m&#8217; ≤ p &lt; m. Since ≤ is transitive,
∀ p&#8217; ∈ pre(m&#8217;): p&#8217; &lt; p ≡ anc(p&#8217;) ⊂ anc(p). By transitive
reduction, no other q ≠ p ∈ pre(m) may belong to anc(p), i.e. ∀ q
≠ p ∈ pre(m): q ∉ anc(p&#8217;) ≡ ¬ q ≤ p&#8217;. Earlier we had p&#8217; &lt;
p so this holds even if q = p, i.e. ∀ q ∈ pre(m): ¬ q ≤ p&#8217;. ∎</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: <cite>parent consistency</cite> entails <cite>context consistency</cite>, even if using
the insecure optimisation above. (If using our original secure definitions, it
holds regardless of <cite>parent consistency</cite>.) Proof sketch: this is long-winded
and not interesting or insightful; do it later and put it in the appendix.</p>
<p>Based on this result, we mandate that real encodings of m <em>must not</em> encode
context(m) but only pre(m), and readers must check that it is an anti-chain
(see below) before committing it to their local history graph. This way, we get
the other two properties for free. If needed, we can calculate context(m) from
pre(m) locally, and this remains secure regardless of naive optimisations.</p>
<p>As a general principle, redundant information is a security liability: it must
be checked for consistency, using the canonical sources of that information -
but then we might as well use those sources to directly calculate it. In these
specific case, we see that enforcing immediacy and anti-chain parents actually
lets us achieve some stronger guarantees for free, i.e. protection against
rewinding of vector clocks.</p>

<div class="section" id="security">
<h2>Security<a class="headerlink" href="#security" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Security dictates that we have some way to enforce the <em>real-world semantics</em>
that we chose earlier, under the invariants defined above. Let&#8217;s proceed:</p>
<div class="section" id="enforcing-semantics-of-le">
<h3>Enforcing semantics of ≤<a class="headerlink" href="#enforcing-semantics-of-le" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>a ≤ b (real-world semantics)</dt>
<dd>The author of b knew the contents of a, when they wrote b.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Our mechanism to achieve this securely (in a sense that we&#8217;ll define) is as
follows. First, we deduce that parent references must at least be immutable and
unforgeable. That is, for a given message m that references p using a string
s[p], it must be the case that an attacker that sees s[p] and wishes to break
our semantics, cannot create a new message p&#8217; that s[p] could also refer to. If
they could, then our semantics is trivially broken.</p>
<p>One simple option to achieve this <cite>unforgeable</cite> property, is to let s[p] be a
hash of the ciphertext of message p. Those familiar with Git will see the
similarities with its data model. <a class="reference internal" href="../appendix/04-extras.html#encoding-message-identifiers"><span>Defining message identifiers</span></a> explores
this and alternatives in more detail.</p>
<p>This leaves attackers with two ways to know a valid reference s[p]: (1) derive
it from its ciphertext, or (2) see it elsewhere, e.g. referenced by a child of
p, <em>without having seen</em> p itself. (1) does not break our semantics, but (2)
does. That is, in message m, the attacker could make a false declaration that
they&#8217;ve seen a real message p (breaking our semantics), if they see someone
else refer to p in a third message n where p ∈ pre(n) - and no-one can
detect whether this declaration is false or true. (Note that this is a distinct
case from falsely declaring that one has seen a fake i.e non-existent message,
which <em>can</em> be detected as described further below.)</p>
<p>We assume that people won&#8217;t do this - there is no strategic benefit in claiming
to know something that you are entitled to know but temporarily don&#8217;t. The
worst that may happen is that someone issues a challenge you cannot answer, but
only your reputation would suffer. Also, if you haven&#8217;t seen the message, you
are unable to verify that the reference is indeed valid, so someone else might
be trying to trick <em>you</em>. If this security assessment turns out to be wrong,
there are <a class="reference internal" href="../appendix/04-extras.html#author-specific-message-identifiers"><span>measures</span></a> we can take to
close this hole, but they are more complex so we ignore them for now.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="enforcing-invariants">
<h3>Enforcing invariants<a class="headerlink" href="#enforcing-invariants" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>First, note the distinction between enforcing the <em>structure</em> vs <em>semantics</em> of
invariants. We enforce structure by writing correct code for our causal order
data structure, and this can be statically checked e.g. that <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">&lt;=</span> <span class="pre">a</span></code> returns
true for all <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code>. By contrast, enforcing semantic reflexivity means to
enforce that: whenever our code does return true in response to executing <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span>
<span class="pre">&lt;=</span> <span class="pre">a</span></code>, this <em>also</em> has the real-world semantics that &#8220;the author of a knew the
contents of a, when they wrote a&#8221;.</p>
<p>For <strong>reflexivity</strong>, this is true by definition of our chosen semantics for
≤, as we just stated. No run-time checks are required.</p>
<p>For <strong>anti-symmetry</strong>, we gain this if our parent references are unforgeable as
required by the previous section. Then, there is no way to generate distinct
messages a, b such that both a ≤ b (i.e. b references a, perhaps indirectly)
and b ≤ a (likewise). This protection is achieved when we specify the hash
algorithm for the protocol; no run-time checks are required.</p>
<p>For <strong>transitivity</strong>, we must show messages to the user in <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sort">topological
order</a>. For each incoming m, if any of its parents p ∈ pre(m) have not yet
been delivered <a class="footnote-reference" href="#dlvr" id="id5">[4]</a>, we place m in a buffer, and wait for all of pre(m) to
be delivered first before delivering m. This allows us to verify that the
parent references are actually of real messages. To protect against DoS, the
buffer should be limited in size; see the next section for details.</p>
<p>The result is that we deliver all of anc(m) before we deliver m, i.e. the user
sees anc(m) before m. This applies for messages the user sends too, assuming we
set the parents correctly. This achieves transitivity on the local side, but it
is quite hard to detect whether <em>other</em> members are doing this. (One option is
to require m to mention <em>all</em> of anc(m), but obviously this costs too much
bandwidth.) But earlier, we argued that there is no incentive for users to
cheat this; we will make this assumption going forward.</p>
<p>For <strong>transitive reduction</strong>, we do this locally using only information from
anc(m). Since messages are only added to the data structure in topological
order, everyone has this information so they can enforce it themselves.
Messages that break this may simply be dropped, with a local UI warning as to
the source. The <a class="reference internal" href="04-state.html#merge-algorithm"><span>merge algorithm for DAGs</span></a> includes a
check that the inputs form an anti-chain, and it may be run on the pre(m) of
every message accepted, including for single-parent messages.</p>
<p>For <strong>author total ordering</strong>, this is detectable only when someone accepts
messages in both forks, which not everyone else might see. Users detecting this
<em>must</em> refuse to participate any further in the session, which (via mechanisms
described in the next chapter) hints to other members that something is wrong.</p>
<p>To help others narrow down the cause of this non-participation, the detecting
user <em>should</em> re-broadcast all messages within both forks to everyone else,
then leave the conversation with a NACK error message that references both
forks. To be clear, this is not security-critical since these messages might be
dropped by an attacker; its purpose is to give a UX improvement in the case
where the attacker does not drop packets. Note that one of the references may
have to be indirect if we already replied to the other fork, to preserve
transitive reduction. We should never need to do this for a triple fork; NACK
should be immediate upon detecting a double fork.</p>

in &#8220;delivery receipt&#8221;; so sometimes we&#8217;ll use the term <cite>accept</cite> instead for
the former concept.</td></tr>

<h3>Detecting transport attacks<a class="headerlink" href="#detecting-transport-attacks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most of these are a straightforward consequences of the previous sections, but
those are rather abstract so we&#8217;ll re-describe them in terms of defences
against &#8220;real-world&#8221; attacks.</p>
<p>By <cite>transport attacks</cite>, we mean replays, re-orders, and drops of packets, by an
attacker that can affect the physical communications infrastructure. We assume
that external cryptographic authentication will allow us to detect packets
injected by a non-member.</p>
<p>Detecting replays is easy, assuming that our decryption scheme verify-decrypts
duplicate packets so that they have the same parents (and contents and other
metadata); then this will be deserialised into an already-existing node in our
transcript graph. If we cache the ciphertext (and there is <a class="reference internal" href="02-consistency.html#single-ciphertext"><span>reason to</span></a>), we don&#8217;t even need to verify-decrypt it the second time.</p>
<p>Enforcing transitivity is basically an exercise in correcting the order of
messages, so we are already covered there.</p>
<p>For drops, let&#8217;s consider <cite>causal drops</cite> first - drops of messages that caused
(are <cite>before</cite>) a message we <em>have</em> already received. Messages in the delivery
buffer will have three types of parents: those already accepted, those also in
the buffer, and those that haven&#8217;t been seen yet. For the last case, this is
either because the parent p doesn&#8217;t exist (the author is lying), or because the
transport is being unreliable or malicious.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t assume the transport is reliable, so we should give it a grace period
within which to expect p to arrive. After this expires, we should assume that
we&#8217;ll never receive p for whatever reason, emit a UI warning (&#8220;referenced
message p didn&#8217;t arrive on time&#8221;), and drop messages that transitively point to
p from the buffer. This is safe even if p turns out to be real and we receive
it later; others&#8217; <a class="reference internal" href="02-consistency.html#reliability"><span>reliability</span></a> schemes will detect this and
resend us the dropped messages. If we do eventually receive p later, we should
cancel the warning, or at least downgrade its severity, based on how timely we
expect the transport to be.</p>
<p>If we never receive p, we cannot know <em>for sure</em> whether the author was lying
or the transport was malicious. In the basic case, there is no incentive for
the author to lie, but if we just <em>assume</em> the transport is malicious (and take
some action A in response to this) then ironically we <em>give</em> the author an
incentive to lie - they can frame the transport to induce us to do A, which may
have unintended consequences. So, we should be careful in how we communicate
this fault to the user, and not imply blame on any party.</p>
<p>Detecting <em>non-causal drops</em> - drops of messages not-before a message we&#8217;ve
already received, and therefore we don&#8217;t see any references to - is more
complex, and we will cover this in <a class="reference internal" href="03-freshness.html"><em>freshness</em></a>.</p>
<p>If the first message has replay protection (e.g. if it is fresh), we also
inductively gain this for the entire session. This is because each message
contains unforgeable references to previous parent messages, so everything is
&#8220;anchored&#8221; to the first non-replayable message. In other words, this ultimately
depends on the session membership control protocol, which we discuss elsewhere.

<div class="section" id="buffering-and-asynchronous-operation">
<h3>Buffering and asynchronous operation<a class="headerlink" href="#buffering-and-asynchronous-operation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Our strong ordering (transitivity) approach requires a reliable transport. If a
message is dropped, this prevents later messages from being displayed. Note
that this is <em>not</em> a security concern, but a reliability one - if an attacker
wants to prevent those messages from being displayed, and is able to drop the
first message, they can just <em>drop the later messages</em> as well.</p>
<p>We can improve reliability with end-to-end recovery (explained <a class="reference internal" href="02-consistency.html#reliability"><span>next</span></a>), but this is less effective in an asynchronous scenario, i.e.
where members may not online at the same time. We depend more heavily on a
third-party service to store-and-forward messages in an intelligent way, e.g.
to resend ciphertext even if the original author is offline. In the worst case
where no two members are online simultaneously, this dependency becomes an
absolute <em>requirement</em>.</p>
<p>Such a service must provide the interface &#8220;send ciphertext T to recipient R&#8221;.
By itself, this should not reduce data security, since we assume there is an
attacker that already stores all ciphertext. (Metadata security is a harder
problem that is outside of our current scope - but at least this architecture
is no worse than existing transports.)</p>
<p>This adds extra development cost in a real application: at present there are
architectural issues with some existing asynchronous delivery or &#8220;push&#8221; systems
that make this sort of reliability awkward; email works, but leaks significant
mounts of metadata. However, we believe that there is demand for a general
reliable asynchronous transport as a piece of core internet infrastructure,
which would be useful for many other services and applications too. So, at
least within the scope of this document, we will work with this assumption, to
clearly divide our problem between security and asynchronous reliability.</p>
<p>We may also explore quasi-reliability schemes, that avoid buffering but still
provide strong ordering. For example, if the transport can deliver large
packets without splitting them, then whenever the user sends a message m, we
can &#8220;piggyback&#8221; all messages from anc(m) that are not <a class="reference internal" href="02-consistency.html#full-ack"><span>fully-acked</span></a> alongside m. So no-one will ever see messages out-of-order, thus
avoiding buffering. This exists already as an ad-hoc practice in email, where
often people leave a quoted parent in the body of their own message.</p>
<p>This is not a full replacement for a reliable transport - if unacked, packets
get larger and larger, and the ability to deliver them in one piece effectively
becomes a reliability problem. However, it could greatly improve the buffer
waiting period for the majority of unreliable cases, and does not require any
complex behaviour on the part of the always-online store-and-forward server.</p>
<p>Other approaches forfeit reliability, and display messages immediately upon
receipt even if received out-of-order. Such strategies necessarily break our
strong ordering property which we consider critical to security, so we won&#8217;t
discuss them further here - but see <a class="reference internal" href="../appendix/04-extras.html#consistency-without-reliability"><span>Consistency without reliability</span></a> for
a more detailed exploration down this path.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-importance-of-strong-ordering">
<h3>The importance of strong ordering<a class="headerlink" href="#the-importance-of-strong-ordering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is common for messages to depend on context for their precise meaning, in
both natural and computer languages; delivering such messages out-of-order is
not even <em>semantically correct</em>. We conjecture that these context-dependent
messages are a majority, based on briefly scanning our own mailboxes and thread
histories. One might argue that humans are pretty good at reconstructing the
order ourselves, but this places an extra burden on the user.</p>
<p>Some have argued that strong ordering is not important for asynchronous and/or
high-latency use cases, and therefore buffering is not worth the supposed UX
cost. But receiving messages out-of-order is <em>itself a UX cost</em>. Futher, strong
ordering may not be important in some cases, but this is definitely not always
true - we can imagine scenarios where critical meetings might take place over
several days, where integrity is more important than timeliness. Therefore, we
think it&#8217;s prudent to prioritise achieving strong security then try to optimise
the UX around this, rather than vice-versa.</p>
<p>Generally, even asynchronous transports are mostly reliable - otherwise they
would have no users. Now, let&#8217;s consider this minority case where out-of-order
delivery might actually occur. Suppose Alice sends message (1) then (2), and
Bob&#8217;s machine receives (2) after time <em>t</em>. The only case where Bob would prefer
to be shown (2) before/without (1) being available, is if (2) does not require
(1) to be understood correctly. As previously conjectured, we assume this is a
minority (of an outer minority). Then, we have the following cases:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Bob receives (1) after a further time <em>t&#8217;</em> &lt; <em>t</em>.</li>
<li>Bob receives (1) after a further time <em>t&#8217;</em> &gt; <em>t</em>.</li>
<li>Bob doesn&#8217;t receive (1) at all, after some timeout <em>T</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We argue that most users won&#8217;t notice (a), that (b) and (c) are more problems
of the transport that incentivises users towards better transports regardless
of whether buffering is done, and that (c) can further be effectively handled
under our system via timeouts and by restarting the session, such as described
in <a class="reference internal" href="../hci.html#hci-ordering"><span>Messages received out-of-order</span></a>.</p>
<p>One might argue that scenarios where strong ordering is security-critical is
also a minority, but we feel it&#8217;s better to achieve this much-needed security
for this minority, than to achieve slightly more convenience for another
less-needy minority.</p>
<p>TODO: describe a hybrid scheme, using lossy ratchets to derive a &#8220;session key&#8221;,
and using this as the long-term key (instead of the real long-term key) in a
strongly-ordered ratchet. this prevents &#8220;drop attacks&#8221; from forcing users to
repeatedly use their long-term key for messaging material.</p>
